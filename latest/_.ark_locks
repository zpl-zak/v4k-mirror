# This file defines what files will request locks automatically when changed.
# You'll want to flag files that are to be considered binary, which means
# that there's not an easy way to merge conflicts.
# However, you may want to flag other kinds of files that may be
# problematic to merge manually (e.g. files that the content can be shuffled when
# saving).
#
# It follows the same format as the .ark_ignore file, which means:
# - you add 1 entry per line
# - entries are case insensitive, so build, BUILD, and Build are all the same
# - # starts a comment, anything after this is ignored
# - * represents any amount of characters
# - ! at the start of the line represents an exclusion
#
# Here's a set of basic ones, feel free to remove any that don't apply to your project.
