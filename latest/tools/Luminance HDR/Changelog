*  the application now remembers the last used directory for
    open/save hdr
    load/save settings
    load input exposures

22-12-2006  Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
v1.4
*  tonemapping dialog: added save... load... line_edit pushbutton widgets.
*  loading input ldr exposures      starts from last used directory.
*  loading input TMO settings file  starts from last used directory.
*  fixed stupid inefficiency while showing hdr.

    Clicking save you'll get the full (100%) input hdr tonemapped with current settings.
*  Cleared some pfs buffers when the TMO dialog gets closed.
*  Added a "Done!" label that shows up when the input ldr exposures have finished loading.

20-12-2006  Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
* changed some #includes
* added comment showing original pfshdrcreate hack: it was NOT in svn, now it's there
  only for future reference, in case it's needed.
* restructuring of svn repository in branches/qt4: moved hdrcreate* files into their own
  directory

18-12-2006  Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
v1.3
* fixed bug: some cameras (NIKON D50) don't write ISO values in the JPEGS. That led to a
  wrong (completely red) hdr result. Now if qtpfsgui doesn't find a ISO value, it uses
  internally a default value of ISO=100 for all input exposures.

15-12-2006  Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
* created branch of qtpfsgui, using Qt4. (in svn the code is in branches/qtpfsgui-qt4)
* the code integrates libpfs/pfstmo/pfshdrcreate, now it's stand-alone.
* the code requires libexiv2-devel
* Compilable both in linux and in windows with mingw.
* supported hdr formats in windows are only: HDR(rgbe) and PFS.
  Linux also supports OpenEXR. Still problems compiling OpenEXR in windows with MinGW,
  seems like no one has ever done it... :(
  Also, OpenEXR is compilable with Cygwin, but Qt (qmake and everything) doesn't work with
  cygwin.
