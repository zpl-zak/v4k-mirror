<h2>Pattanaik</h2>

The implementation of a tone mapping operator as described in:
<P>
Time-Dependent Visual Adaptation for Realistic Image Display.
S.N. Pattanaik, J. Tumblin, H. Yee, and D.P. Greenberg.
In Proceedings of ACM SIGGRAPH 2000.
<P>
This operator requires properly calibrated image data (in cd/m2) and
its results should be gamma corrected.
<P>
The local version of this operator is based on the following paper:
<P>
Adaptive Gain Control For High Dynamic Range Image Display.
S.N. Pattanaik, H. Yee.
In proceedings of SCCG 2002.
<P>

<H3>OPTIONS</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>Multiplier</B><DD>
<P>
Multiply input values by a multiplier value. 
Useful if input data is not calibrated. Default value: 1.0
<DT><B>Local Tone Mapping</B><DD>
<P>
Use local version of the tone mapping. Time-dependent effects are
cancelled while using local version, global version is used by
default.
<DT><B>Cone Level</B><DD>
<P>
Set the adaptation level for cones. By default, the
adaptation level is calculated as a logarithmic average of luminance
in the input image.
<DT><B>Rod Level</B><DD>
<P>
Set the adaptation level for rods. By default, the adaptation level is
calculated as a logarithmic average of luminance in the input image.
