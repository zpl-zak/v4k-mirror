<h2>Features Overview</h2>

<h3>Streamlined Localized User Interface</h3>

<p>Creating HDR files is very easy: you just drop your bracketed shots from file or photos manager to the main window and in few more clicks you have an HDR file which you can then tonemap.</p>

<p>Luminance HDR is available in the following languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chinese</li>
<li>Czech (outdated)</li>
<li>Danish</li>
<li>English</li>
<li>Finnish</li>
<li>French (outdated)</li>
<li>German</li>
<li>Hungarian (outdated)</li>
<li>Indonesian (outdated)</li>
<li>Italian</li>
<li>Polish (outdated)</li>
<li>Portuguese (Brazilian)</li>
<li>Romanian</li>
<li>Russian</li>
<li>Spanish</li>

</ul>

<p>If your language is not supported or localization is incomplete or outdated 
and you are willing to take care of that, please learn 
<a href="contributing_translating.html">how to do it</a>.</p>

<h3>Supported HDR File Formats</h3>

<p>Luminance HDR reads and writes:</p>

<ul>

<li>Logluv TIFF (.tif)</li>
<li>16/32bpc TIFF (.tif)</li>
<li>PFS stream (.pfs)</li>
<li>FITS (.fit)</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally Raw images can be opened (using LibRaw) as both HDR and LDR images.</p>

<ul>
<li>JPEG</li>

</ul>

<p>Luminance HDR can also write Exif metadata to JPEG, PNG and TIFF files using Exiv2.</p>

<h3>Extensive Help System</h3>

<p>We don't really pretend that HDR imaging is easy. It surely can be easy if 
lousy results is what you want. For the rest of you we bundle a solid help 
system to help you getting the most of your pictures.</p>

<p>The help system is, again, localizable. Right now only English version is 
available, but you can <a href="contributing_translating.html">contribute 
a translation</a> into your native language, if you really want to.</p>
