<h2>Programming</h2>

<p>Documentation for potential programmers isn't ready at this time. Please come back later or <a href="resources.html">ask your questions</a>.</p>

<p>Pfstmo which we use as a backend will become a library eventually, so we shall have to introduce some changes. The other plan is to start using some solid graphics lib like GEGL of VIPS to deal with images larger than RAM in a sane way. If you want to help the Luminance HDR team with that, do tell us.</p>
